This repository contains the matlab scripts used to complete the final project for the Fall 2022 graduate State Estimation course at the University of Colorado - Boulder. The system in the analysis is a two-agent system consisting of one unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

Each system was provided with a corresponding nonlinear continuous-time (NLCT) dynamics model. The UGV dynamics model was given the following form:

# Include image of UGV model

The UAV dynamics model has the following form:

# Include image of UAV model

As a system corresponding to both models, the following model can be made:

# Include image of coupled dynamics model
